# libnodegit

Asynchronous git bindings for node.js inspired by similar projects
[node-gitteh](https://github.com/libgit2/node-gitteh) and
[nodegit](https://github.com/tbranyen/nodegit). Built using
[libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com/) library and Google's v8/chrome.

## Installation

Mac OS X/Linux/Unix
Install nodegit by cloning source from GitHub.

*TODO*: Publish to npm

	# Install node.js
	# Install libgit2, [have a look at issue #1]
	$ git clone https://github.com/jaseemabid/libnodegit.git libnodegit
	$ npm install ./libnodegit

## Running tests

	$ cd libnodegit
	$ npm test

## Lint

	$ cd libnodegit
	$ npm lint

## Freemind map

There is an org-mode file
[here](https://github.com/jaseemabid/libnodegit/wiki/libnodegit.org). Export it
to freemind map by *M-x org-export-as-freemind* in emacs.

## Project milestones

Quite incomplete. Preview [here](https://github.com/jaseemabid/libnodegit/wiki/Milestones)

## Resources

A long boring academic
 [report](https://github.com/jaseemabid/Major-project-report) made strictly for
 academic purposes, which might not serve as a project introduction for a hacker
 wanting to use the library. See the test suite for the API.

## Examples

## License and legal stuff

MIT it is. You can use the library anyway you want but I'll be happy to get back
any code changes you make. Linking back appreciated.
